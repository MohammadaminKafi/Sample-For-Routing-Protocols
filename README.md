# SampleForRoutingProtocols

A comprehensive sample for configuring routing protocols on Cisco routers using Cisco Packet Tracer v8.2.1.0117.

## Overview

This project includes configurations for RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP routing protocols, with all protocols redistributed for efficient routing across the network. Additionally, HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) is configured for a segment of the topology to ensure network redundancy and reliability.

### Configurations Included:
- **Routing Protocols**: RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP
- **HSRP**: Configured for part of the topology to provide high availability.
- **Servers**: Configured to support DHCP, Mail, Web, and DNS services.

This project was developed as the final assignment for the Computer Networks Lab 1 course.
